My real name is Harry Pierson, but I've gone by "DevHawk" online since I [started my now-neglected blog back in 2003](http://devhawk.net/blog/new-and-improved-devhawk).

In August 2023, I joined [DBOS](https://www.dbos.dev/), a startup radically rethinking operation systems, databases and distributed systems. It's the latest startup from industry luminary and Turing award winner [Michael Stonebraker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker). In October 2023, DBOS released our first ["friends and family" preview](https://docs.dbos.dev/category/getting-started/). For more background on DBOS, check out this [article from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2023/08/15/put-the-os-in-the-database-performance-cybersecurity-and-endurance-in-the-cloud/) and/or this [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB4bJqDzsU8) 

I'm probably best known for my involvement in the Microsoft development community. I was with with Microsoft from October 1998 until June of 2019 - over 20 years! In that time, I had a wide variety of different jobs. I started in Microsoft Consulting before moving into a technical evangelism role. I spent a short time as an architect for Microsoft's internal IT department. When I finally joined the product groups, I started as the program manager for [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) before spending most of the [second half of my MSFT career](~/blog/joining-windows) as part of the Windows team. I spent the Windows 8 and 8.1 product cycles as a program manager on the team that built [Windows Runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Runtime). After four years as a PM, I got tired of writing specs so I [switched to a developer role](~/blog/putting-the-dev-back-in-devhawk). I spent most of 2014 with the [Midori research project](http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/) working on [C# for Systems](http://joeduffyblog.com/2013/12/27/csharp-for-systems-programming/). In 2015, I rejoined joined the core Windows team, working on the cross-platform plumbing that powers [SmartGlass](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/smartglass) which eventually evolved into [Project Rome](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/project-rome). After that, I helped form the [xlang](https://github.com/Microsoft/xlang) team, with the goal of bringing Windows Runtime's language projection technology cross platform.

In June 2019, I traded in my blue badge to [join the new Seattle office of NEO Global Development](http://devhawk.net/blog/2019/6/2/my-next-adventure). In my time as the NGD Enterprise Chief Software Architect, I spearheaded the development of [Neo Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express), the [Neo Smart Contract Debugger for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-contract-debug), [Neo-Test](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-test) and [Neo Visual DevTracker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-visual-devtracker).

I always say that the only way to build great products is to talk to the people who use it. So feel free to contact me - [Discord](https://discord.com/users/514663152730898462), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/devhawk), <a rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@devhawk">Mastodon</a> and good old [email](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) are usually the best ways.
