### Greetings Programs!


My real name is Harry Pierson, but I've gone by "DevHawk" online since I [started my now-neglected blog back in 2003](http://devhawk.net/blog/new-and-improved-devhawk).

I am the Chief Software Architect for [NGD Enterprise](https://ngdenterprise.com/). We build [world-class developer tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit) for the [Neo blockchain](https://neo.org/). Some of the stuff we build includes:

* [Neo N3 Tutorials](https://ngdenterprise.com/neo-tutorials/)
* [Neo Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express), a developer focused Neo PrivateNet 
* [Neo Smart Contract Debugger for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-contract-debug)
* [Neo Visual DevTracker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-visual-devtracker), a blockchain explorer the runs inside of Visual Studio Code.
* [Visual Token Designer](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/visual-token-designer), a visual designer for the [InterWork Alliance](https://interwork.org/) [Token Taxonomy Framework](https://interwork.org/frameworks/token-taxonomy-framework/)
* [Neo-Test](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-test), a framework for unit testing Neo smart contracts

Before joining the NGD Enterprise, I was with with Microsoft for over 20 years. In that time, I had a wide variety of different jobs. I started in Microsoft Consulting before moving into a technical evangelism role. I spent a short time as an architect for Microsoft's internal IT department. When I finally joined the product groups, I started as the program manager for [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) before spending most of the [second half of my MSFT career](http://devhawk.net/blog/joining-windows) as part of the Windows team. I spent the Windows 8 and 8.1 product cycles as a program manager on the team that built [Windows Runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Runtime). After four years as a PM, I got tired of writing specs so I [switched to a developer role](http://devhawk.net/blog/putting-the-dev-back-in-devhawk). I spent most of 2014 with the [Midori research project](http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/) working on [C# for Systems](http://joeduffyblog.com/2013/12/27/csharp-for-systems-programming/). In 2015, I rejoined joined the core Windows team, working on the cross-platform plumbing that powers [SmartGlass](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/smartglass) which eventually evolved into [Project Rome](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/project-rome). After that, I helped form the [xlang](https://github.com/Microsoft/xlang) team, with the goal of bringing Windows Runtime's language projection technology cross platform.

I always say that the only way to build great products is to talk to the people who use it. So feel free to contact me - [Discord](https://discord.com/users/514663152730898462), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/devhawk) and good old [email](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) are usually the best ways.
