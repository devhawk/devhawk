My real name is Harry Pierson, but I've gone by "DevHawk" online since I [started my now-neglected blog back in 2003](http://devhawk.net/blog/new-and-improved-devhawk).

I am the Chief Software Architect for [NGD Enterprise](https://ngdenterprise.com/). We build [world-class developer tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit) for the [Neo blockchain](https://neo.org/) including:

* [Neo N3 Tutorials](https://ngdenterprise.com/neo-tutorials/)
* [Neo Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express), a developer focused Neo PrivateNet 
* [Neo Smart Contract Debugger for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-contract-debug)
* [Neo Visual DevTracker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-visual-devtracker), a blockchain explorer the runs inside of Visual Studio Code.
* [Visual Token Designer](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/visual-token-designer), a visual designer for the [InterWork Alliance](https://interwork.org/) [Token Taxonomy Framework](https://interwork.org/frameworks/token-taxonomy-framework/)
* [Neo-Test](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-test), a framework for unit testing Neo smart contracts

I always say that the only way to build great products is to talk to the people who use it. So feel free to contact me - [Discord](https://discord.com/users/514663152730898462), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/devhawk) and good old [email](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) are usually the best ways.
