My real name is Harry Pierson, but I've gone by "DevHawk" online since I [started my now-neglected blog back in 2003](http://devhawk.net/blog/new-and-improved-devhawk).

I always say that the only way to build great products is to talk to the people who use it. So feel free to contact me - [Discord](https://discord.com/users/514663152730898462), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/devhawk), <a rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@devhawk">Mastodon</a> and good old [email](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) are usually the best ways.
